## What are the features of Native RC 48 Reverb Classics VST?
 
Native RC 48 Reverb Classics VST has two algorithms that provide different reverb shapes and sizes. The first algorithm is called Hall A, and it creates huge halls with long tails and impressive sound design possibilities. The second algorithm is called Hall B, and it creates smaller halls with more natural decay and diffusion. You can switch between the algorithms with a simple click on the interface[^3^].
 
The interface of Native RC 48 Reverb Classics VST is ultra-intuitive and easy to use. It has four main knobs that control the most important parameters: Pre-Delay, Time, Density and Color. Pre-Delay adjusts the time between the direct sound and the first reflection. Time adjusts the length of the reverb tail. Density adjusts the amount of reflections in the reverb tail. Color adjusts the tone of the reverb, from bright to dark[^3^].
 
Besides these knobs, there are also some advanced controls that let you fine-tune your reverb sound. You can adjust the modulation depth and speed, the high and low cut filters, the early reflections level and shape, the diffusion level and shape, and the output level. You can also use the visual display to see the reverb shape and adjust it with your mouse[^3^].
 
## How to use Native RC 48 Reverb Classics VST for amazing sound design?
 
Native RC 48 Reverb Classics VST can be used for various purposes, such as adding depth and texture to your tracks, creating realistic or surreal spaces, enhancing acoustic instruments and vocals, or transforming sound into sound design elements. Here are some tips on how to use Native RC 48 Reverb Classics VST for amazing sound design:
 
- Use Hall A for creating large and lush reverbs that can fill up your mix or create ambient pads and drones. Try increasing the Time and Density knobs for longer and denser reverb tails. Experiment with different Color settings to change the tone of the reverb. Use the modulation controls to add some movement and variation to the reverb tail[^1^] [^2^].
- Use Hall B for creating smaller and more natural reverbs that can add some space and realism to your tracks. Try decreasing the Time and Density knobs for shorter and less dense reverb tails. Experiment with different Pre-Delay settings to change the distance between the source and the reverb. Use the early reflections controls to adjust the level and shape of the first reflections[^1^] [^2^].
- Use both algorithms together for creating complex and hybrid reverbs that can combine different shapes and sizes. Try using different settings for each algorithm and blending them with the output level control. Experiment with different combinations of filters, modulation, diffusion and early reflections to create unique reverb sounds[^1^] [^2^].
- Use Native RC 48 Reverb Classics VST as a sound design tool by applying it to different sources, such as synths, drums, vocals, or even noise. Try using extreme settings for Time, Density, Color, modulation, filters, diffusion and early reflections to create new sounds out of your original source. Use automation or MIDI control to change the parameters over time for more dynamic results[^1^
